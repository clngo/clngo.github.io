                        Hello! I am currently an upcoming sophomore at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
                        I'm deeply passionate about helping others through the improvements in technology while discovering opportunities to grow personally. 
                        I have always been curious about the intricacies of technology which drives me to create personal projects, honing my problem-solving
                        skills and coding expertise. 
                        I thrive on collaboration by working with like-minded individuals who share a common commitment to making a positive impact.
                        My career interests lie in software development, computer programming, and information analyst. 
                        My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to help others through safer and more efficient technology. 
                        I always look forward to connecting with you! Please reach out to me for any inquiries at clngo654@gmail.com
