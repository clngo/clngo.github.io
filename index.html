                    An energetic collaborator in solving real-world problems through computer vision. 
                    
                    Hello! I am
                    currently a rising 3rd-year student with a major in computer science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
                    I'm deeply passionate about helping others through the improvements in technology while discovering
                    opportunities to grow personally. The interaction of computers and humans drives me to create
                    personal projects, honing my problem-solving skills and coding expertise. I thrive on collaboration
                    by working with like-minded individuals who share a common commitment to making a positive impact.
                    My career interests lie in computer vision, machine learning, and AI.
