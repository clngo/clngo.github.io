                        Using the MediaPipe Hand Landmarker, enabling accurate landmark detection of hands, ensuring robust and efficient performance.
                        Successfully integrated the hand detection device with image data, both as static data and in real-time continuous streams.
                        Utilized image coordinates to design and implement a visual effects rendering system overlaying effects for detected landmarks.
                        Accommodated multiple hand detection and provided accurate handedness identification (left/right hand) for each detected hand.

                        Design an inheritance hierarchy with an abstract superclass and multiple concrete subclasses which incorporates method overriding.
                        Created comprehensive unit tests to achieve full code coverage, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the class's functionality.
